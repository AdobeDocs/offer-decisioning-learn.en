# Create rules

This video shows how to create rules in [!DNL Offer Decisioning]. Rules or "decision rules" are one of the required building block components of personalized offers. Rules are built using the events and attributes in Platform's Real-time Customer Profile and form the eligibility constraints of offers. For example, a rule could be used to restrict an offer for snow shovels to customers who live in regions where it snows.
